## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first project implementing light and dark mode functionality. Through this experience, I gained hands-on understanding of how to manage theme switching using React's state management system. While I initially attempted to use Tailwind's built-in dark mode utilities, I found React's state approach more intuitive for my current understanding.



### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to deepen my knowledge of Tailwind's dark mode implementation. I opted for React state management in this project, but I'd like to explore Tailwind's native approach to better understand its advantages and when each method is most appropriate. This will help me choose the best solution for future projects.
